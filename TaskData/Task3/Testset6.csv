fj1211,"In the carpentry field, I've been working on balanced material tests and have already ensured that the test specimens are prepared and documented according to AWI standards, using the correct materials, dimensions, and additives. What should I do next?",fj1222,Suspension in Environmental Chamber
fj1222,"In the carpentry field, I've been working on balanced material tests and have already suspended the specimens vertically in the environmental chamber with at least 6.4 mm (0.250"") spacing between them. What should I do next in the testing process?",fj1223,Testing at Elevated Humidity
fj1223,"In the carpentry field, I've encountered a problem related to balanced material tests. During the testing process, I've completed raising the relative humidity to 70% and maintained the temperature at 75°F for 336 hours. What should I do next?",fj1224,Testing at Reduced Humidity
fj1224,"In the carpentry field, I've been working with balanced material tests and encountered an issue during the testing process. I've already adjusted the relative humidity to 25% and increased the temperature to 95°F for an additional 336 hours. What should I do next?",fj1225,Measurements Post-Conditioning
fj1225,"In the carpentry field, I've encountered an issue with Balanced Material Tests. During the testing process, I measured deviations in flatness and warp along four axes within one hour of removing the specimen. What should I do next?",fj120,End
fj1213,"In the carpentry field, I faced an issue with Balanced Material Tests. During the evaluation and reporting phase, I've continuously monitored and recorded environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, throughout the testing process. What should I do next?",fj1232,Recording Largest Deviations
fj1232,"In the carpentry field, I came across an issue with Balanced Material Tests. While working on evaluation and reporting, I've recorded the largest observed deviations in flatness and warp along each of the four axes. What should I do next?",fj1233,Determining Performance Compliance
fj1233,"In the carpentry field, I've faced a challenge with Balanced Material Tests. I've finished evaluating and comparing measurements against tolerance thresholds for the Premium, Custom, and Economy categories. What should be my next step?",fj1234,Test Documentation
